<h1 align="center">Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Diego</h1>
<h3 align="center">A passionate software development student at 42 Barcelona</h3>

- At the last stage of my learning adventure at 42. Its no-teachers, learn by doing, peer-to-peer take on software development study has helped me, not only to master essential coding skills, but also other crucial ones, like time management, assertiveness and initiative.

- Currently looking to make my first steps in my coding career, as I already feel confident in my skills and aptitudes.

- Just finished working on a web server implementation from scratch in C++. It has been a deep dive on socket programming, multiplex I/O handling and the HTTP protocol. [Webserv 42](https://github.com/dtome-pe/webserv)

- I have also been working on containerization and Docker usage. [Inception 42](https://github.com/dtome-pe/inception)
